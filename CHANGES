Changes in 2.0
--------------

  * Use new API to communicate with WFx00 firmware. Thus, version 2.0 is
    incompatible with firmwares < 2.0
  * New architecture for API handling
  * API error handling improvements
  * CHANGES and README files are now in public release
  * Fix multiple timing issues in AP when stations enable power saving
  * Fix compatibility with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
  * Fix possible race contditions during chip initialisation
  * Fix issue with Short GI negociation. Short GI was not enabled even if
    remote support it
  * Fix issue with Tx power. Tx power was correctly restored after a scan
  * Fix issue with HT features. HT features was not always reseted between
    sessions
  * Report error if configured MTU is not supported (> 1500 bytes)

Changes in 1.6
--------------

  * Fix maximum bitrate in IBSS mode
  * Show interface id in traces
  * Improve SDIO bandwith by improving usage of block mode
  * Improve SPI bandwith by ensuring that buffer size are 32bits aligned
  * Fix crash during join when BSS is NULL
  * Fix possible race condition while calling ieee80211_bss_get_ie()
  * Fix driver stuck during unbind (mainly with SDIO, but also with SPI)

Changes in 1.5 (not released)
-----------------------------

  * Introduce a framework to change arbitrary fileds in WSM messages
  * Replace ldpc and sgi module parameters with a dynamic parameters in debugfs:
      /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/wfx/wsm_params
  * Add files in debugfs to change contents of WSM_MIB_ID_BEACON_WAKEUP_PERIOD
  * Add files in debugfs to change content of WSM_MIB_ID_BLOCK_ACK_POLICY
  * Enable LDPC with hardware revision >= A2
  * Replace traces for SDIO/SPI messages with tracepoints (see README for usage)
  * Replace traces for WSM send/receive messages with tracepoints (see README
    for usage)
  * Remove traces related to wake-up. They can be replaced by tracespoints (see
    README for examples)
  * Fix beacon wakeup period that was (loudly) ignored by firmware
  * Fix bug with unaligned buffers and SDIO access
  * Fix badly detected flags in received frames.
  * Bump API to 0.6.7
  * Implement a better work-around for SDIO messages of 512 bytes length
  * Change error reported when a WSM message fail

Changes in 1.4.2
----------------

  * Fix bug with SDIO message of 512 bytes introduced in 1.4
  * Support hardware revision A2

Changes in 1.4.1
----------------

  * Do not hide ldpc and sgi module parameter in ppublic version (revert change
    from 1.4)

Changes in 1.4
--------------

  * Reset and Wake-up gpios should been declared from device tree. Process is
    described in README. YOU HAVE TO UPDATE YOUR DEVICE TREE (IPWHIFER-275,
    IPWHIFER-274)
  * Driver is now packed in one module named wfx.ko. Module aliases allow to
    provide a bit compatibility but this change may break external processes.
  * MAC address is fetched from chip OTP memory. macadress module parameter
    does not exist anymore. It is possible to change macadress using standard
    Linux tools (or DT). Notice you need firmware >= 1.2.13 to make this work
    properly
  * Allow to use an external IRQ pin instead of SDIO native one (not yet
    supported by firmware)
  * Drop wfx_refclk module parameter
  * Drop bssloss_mitigation module parameter
  * Drop wfx_ba_*x_tids module parameters
  * Module parameters ldpc and sgi was now available only for internal versions
  * Fix race condition during firmware loading
  * Fix buffer overflow while printing bootloader label
  * Fix potential memory allocation failure during firmware loading
  * Faster chip init (350ms vs 600ms previously)
  * Network interface does not appears if PDS does not correctly load
  * PDS name can now been overloaded from DT
  * Driver try to test bus communication and report useful errors during
    probing
  * Only useful messages are emitted during driver probing
  * Device name in DT has been changed to follow upstream rules from
    vendor-prefixes.txt (legacy naming are also recognized)
  * Documentation explain how to properly setup SDIO host to allow to reset
    chip without reboot whole target
  * Add documentation about debug features
  * Add documentation about driver architecture
  * Driver now build if kernel does enable SPI or MMC support
  * You can now run 'make clean modules' without race condition between targets
  * Driver now build without warning on various architecture/kernel versions
  * Checkpatch results are now reported during continuous integration (but
    there is yet plenty of errors)
  * Spinlock bss_loss_lock is now a mutex

Changes in 1.3.0
----------------

  * Driver is now maintained outside of reference kernel. This prominent change
    may break some process.
  * PDS format changes. It is now necessary to use a compressed PDS.
  * Driver now compile with kernels from 4.4 to 4.18
  * Driver now autoload when chip is detected on SDIO bus
  * Chipset CW1200 is no more supported by this driver
  * Testmode is automatically enabled if kernel enable NL80211_TESTMODE
  * Jenkins recipe is now versioned with this driver
  * When compiled with "_NO_PROD", output files does not have different name
